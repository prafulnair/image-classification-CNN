# image-classification-CNN
As I ventured into the world of machine learning, ANN and CNN, I took some time and created an opportunity for myself by trying to implement what I have theoretically learned. Using Keras, I have modelled a Convolutional Neural Network, and used it to solve binary classification problem. Is it a Cat or a Dog? :))
